      <string name="chairman">
        Mr. Shamim Ahmed joined as Chairman of the Trustee Board (Gulshan Foundation for Education Development) of Sylhet International University on the 31st October, 2009 when his uncle Mr. Kutubuddin Ahmed retired on health grounds. Mr. Shamim Ahmed is a scion of an illustrious family which always played a philanthropic role in the social development of Sylhet region. His father late Moin Uddin Ahmed donated land and did the construction work at his own expense to establish Moin Uddin Adarsha Mohila College in 1984. His uncle Mr. Kutubuddin Ahmed worked hand in hand with his father in all these philanthropic work. Subsequently in the vicinity of Moin Uddin Adarsha Mohila College, Sylhet International University was also established in 2001 on land donated by the same family. Not only the land but also the funds required for the initial construction work was donated by the family of Mr. Shamim. A businessman by profession, Mr. Shamim Ahmed has a tight schedule of making frequent trips to different countries. Yet he has all the acumen and administrative capability to guide Sylhet International University as the Chairman of its Trustee Board. We hope that under his able guidance Sylhet International University will soon become internationally famous seat of learning and research.
