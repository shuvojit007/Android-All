    <string name="info">The principal aim of the Sylhet International University is to provide high quality education at undergraduate and postgraduate levels relevant to the needs of a dynamic society. The courses and curricula are so designed as to enable a student to enter into the world of work or pursue higher academic and professional goals with a sound academic foundation. The academic goal of the university is not just to make the students pass the examination and get the degree but to equip them with the means to become productive members of the community and continue the practice of lifelong learning. Sylhet International University was established from the very beginning with a campus of its own. The campus is very much within the city of Sylhet though it is relatively calm and quiet, just suitable for the pursuit of knowledge. It is within walking distance from the Osmani Medical College Hospital. Mr. Shamim Ahmed joined as Chairman of the Trustee Board (Gulshan Foundation for Education Development) of Sylhet International University on the 31st October, 2009 when his uncle Mr. Kutubuddin Ahmed retired on health grounds. Mr. Shamim Ahmed is a scion of an illustrious family which always played a philanthropic role in the social development of Sylhet region. His father late Moin Uddin Ahmed donated land and did the construction work at his own expense to establish Moin Uddin Adarsha Mohila College in 1984. His uncle Mr. Kutubuddin Ahmed worked hand in hand with his father in all these philanthropic work. Subsequently in the vicinity of Moin Uddin Adarsha Mohila College, Sylhet International University was also established in 2001 on land donated by the same family. Not only the land but also the funds required for the initial construction work was donated by the family of Mr. Shamim. Mr. Shamim Ahmed, now in his early forties, is a smart gentleman with a brilliant academic career. Having been schooled at Blue Bird School and Sylhet Government Pilot School, Mr. Shamim Ahmed achieved talent scheme scholarships both at primary and junior school levels. Thereafter, he obtained good results at SSC and HSC examinations from science group and graduated with BSc degree from Sylhet Government College. He then went to United Kingdom for higher studies and added to his career the degrees of BSc. (Engg.) in Electronics and MBA. A businessman by profession, Mr. Shamim Ahmed has a tight schedule of making frequent trips to different countries. Yet he has all the acumen and administrative capability to guide Sylhet International University as the Chairman of its Trustee Board. We hope that under his able guidance Sylhet International University will soon become internationally famous seat of learning and research.</string>

        "Material is the metaphor.\n\n"

        "A material metaphor is the unifying theory of a rationalized space and a system of motion."
        "The material is grounded in tactile reality, inspired by the study of paper and ink, yet "
        "technologically advanced and open to imagination and magic.\n"
        "Surfaces and edges of the material provide visual cues that are grounded in reality. The "
        "use of familiar tactile attributes helps users quickly understand affordances. Yet the "
        "flexibility of the material creates new affordances that supercede those in the physical "
        "world, without breaking the rules of physics.\n"
        "The fundamentals of light, surface, and movement are key to conveying how objects move, "
        "interact, and exist in space and in relation to each other. Realistic lighting shows "
        "seams, divides space, and indicates moving parts.\n\n"

        "Bold, graphic, intentional.\n\n"

        "The foundational elements of print based design typography, grids, space, scale, color, "
        "and use of imagery guide visual treatments. These elements do far more than please the "
        "eye. They create hierarchy, meaning, and focus. Deliberate color choices, edge to edge "
        "imagery, large scale typography, and intentional white space create a bold and graphic "
        "interface that immerse the user in the experience.\n"
        "An emphasis on user actions makes core functionality immediately apparent and provides "
        "waypoints for the user.\n\n"

        "Motion provides meaning.\n\n"

        "Motion respects and reinforces the user as the prime mover. Primary user actions are "
        "inflection points that initiate motion, transforming the whole design.\n"
        "All action takes place in a single environment. Objects are presented to the user without "
        "breaking the continuity of experience even as they transform and reorganize.\n"
        "Motion is meaningful and appropriate, serving to focus attention and maintain continuity. "
        "Feedback is subtle yet clear. Transitions are efﬁcient yet coherent.\n\n"

        "3D world.\n\n"

        "The material environment is a 3D space, which means all objects have x, y, and z "
        "dimensions. The z-axis is perpendicularly aligned to the plane of the display, with the "
        "positive z-axis extending towards the viewer. Every sheet of material occupies a single "
        "position along the z-axis and has a standard 1dp thickness.\n"
        "On the web, the z-axis is used for layering and not for perspective. The 3D world is "
        "emulated by manipulating the y-axis.\n\n"

        "Light and shadow.\n\n"

        "Within the material environment, virtual lights illuminate the scene. Key lights create "
        "directional shadows, while ambient light creates soft shadows from all angles.\n"
        "Shadows in the material environment are cast by these two light sources. In Android "
        "development, shadows occur when light sources are blocked by sheets of material at "
        "various positions along the z-axis. On the web, shadows are depicted by manipulating the "
        "y-axis only. The following example shows the card with a height of 6dp.\n\n"

        "Resting elevation.\n\n"

        "All material objects, regardless of size, have a resting elevation, or default elevation "
        "that does not change. If an object changes elevation, it should return to its resting "
        "elevation as soon as possible.\n\n"

        "Component elevations.\n\n"

        "The resting elevation for a component type is consistent across apps (e.g., FAB elevation "
        "does not vary from 6dp in one app to 16dp in another app).\n"
        "Components may have different resting elevations across platforms, depending on the depth "
        "of the environment (e.g., TV has a greater depth than mobile or desktop).\n\n"

        "Responsive elevation and dynamic elevation offsets.\n\n"

        "Some component types have responsive elevation, meaning they change elevation in response "
        "to user input (e.g., normal, focused, and pressed) or system events. These elevation "
        "changes are consistently implemented using dynamic elevation offsets.\n"
        "Dynamic elevation offsets are the goal elevation that a component moves towards, relative "
        "to the component’s resting state. They ensure that elevation changes are consistent "
        "across actions and component types. For example, all components that lift on press have "
        "the same elevation change relative to their resting elevation.\n"
        "Once the input event is completed or cancelled, the component will return to its resting "
        "elevation.\n\n"

        "Avoiding elevation interference.\n\n"

        "Components with responsive elevations may encounter other components as they move between "
        "their resting elevations and dynamic elevation offsets. Because material cannot pass "
        "through other material, components avoid interfering with one another any number of ways, "
        "whether on a per component basis or using the entire app layout.\n"
        "On a component level, components can move or be removed before they cause interference. "
        "For example, a floating action button (FAB) can disappear or move off screen before a "
        "user picks up a card, or it can move if a snackbar appears.\n"
        "On the layout level, design your app layout to minimize opportunities for interference. "
        "For example, position the FAB to one side of stream of a cards so the FAB won’t interfere "
        "when a user tries to pick up one of cards.\n\n"
